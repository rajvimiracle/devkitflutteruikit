       "under Mughal emperors Babur, Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir and Shah Jahan.""\n"

       "with a booming tourism industry, along with footwear, leather and other "
       "manufacturing. The Taj Mahal and the Agra Fort are UNESCO World "
       "Heritage Sites. ""\n"

       "and reestablished by Sikandar Lodhi in 1504â€“1505; the other of the "
       "modern city, founded by Akbar in 1558, on the right bank of the river"
